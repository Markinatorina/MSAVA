## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have discovered a security vulnerability, **please do not open a public issue**.

Instead, report it **privately** through GitHub's [Security Advisories feature](https://github.com/Markinatorina/MSAVA/security/advisories/new). This ensures responsible disclosure and gives us time to investigate and patch the issue before public disclosure.

### When to Use the Security Report Feature
Use the **GitHub Security Advisory form** for any of the following:
- Unauthorized access or privilege escalation
- Data leakage or exposure of sensitive information
- Authentication bypass or injection attacks
- Remote code execution or critical denial-of-service risks

### Response Expectations
- You will receive an acknowledgment within **48 hours**
- We aim to provide an initial assessment within **5 business days**
- Accepted vulnerabilities will be patched, with credit given upon request

## Reporting Other Issues

For all **non-security-related issues** (bugs, performance problems, feature requests, documentation errors, etc.), please use the standard [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/Markinatorina/MSAVA/issues).

This helps the project maintain transparency and allows the community to contribute to resolution.

Thank you for helping keep my project secure!
